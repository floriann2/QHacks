# QHacks
Inspiration
In an AI course, an assignment was to build a simple chatbot. We took concepts learned in class and worked it into a web application that focuses on QHacks.

What it does
It's an AI that chats with you - answer it's questions or say anything and it'll respond!

How I built it
First we built the application using Javascript/JQuery using a simple textbox and console output. Then we added CSS and "chat bubbles" to make it feel like a regular conversation.

Challenges I ran into
Figuring out RegEx in Javascript
Getting the response format correct using CSS ## Accomplishments that I'm proud of The more you interact with the chatbot, the more it seems like it could be human. We made our responses conversational, and are proud of the outcome. ## What I learned How to manipulate and then map user input segments to custom responses in a way that seems almost human-like. ## What's next for QHacks Chatbot
Adding more responses
Add response animations or delays
