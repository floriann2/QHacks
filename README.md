# QHacks
---
## Inspiration:

In an AI course I took at Queen's University, an assignment was to build a simple chatbot. We took concepts learned in class and worked it into a web application that we made/presented at our school's annual hackathon (QHacks).

## What It Does

It's an AI that chats with you - answer it's questions or say anything and it'll respond!

## How I Built It

First we built the application using Javascript/JQuery using a simple textbox and console output. Then we added CSS and "chat bubbles" to make it feel like a regular conversation.

## Challenges

Figuring out RegEx in Javascript

Getting the response format correct using CSS 

## Accomplishments

The more you interact with the chatbot, the more it seems like it could be human. We made our responses conversational, and are proud of the outcome.

## What I Learned
How to manipulate and then map user input segments to custom responses in a way that seems almost human-like.

## What's next for QHacks Chatbot
Adding more responses
Add response animations and/or delays
